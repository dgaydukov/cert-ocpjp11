### Basics
There are 6 bit manipulation operators:
* `&` (bitwise AND operation) - result bit is 1 if both corresponding bits are 1
* `|` (bitwise OR operation) - result bit is 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1
* `^` (bitwise XOR operation) - result bit is 1 if the corresponding bits are different
* `~` (bitwise NOT operation) - flips each bit (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0)
* `<<` (shifts the bits of the number to the left by n) - equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 for each shift
* `>>` (shifts the bits of the number to the right by n) - equivalent to dividing the number by 2 for each shift
* `>>>` (shifts the bits to the right, filling the leftmost bits with zeroes)

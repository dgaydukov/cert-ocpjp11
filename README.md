* [Mock exam programmer II](https://enthuware.com/java-certification-mock-exams/oracle-certified-professional/ocp-java-11-exam-ii-1z0-816)

##### Exam
I've to pass 2 exams. This is because I didn't hold java 8 cert. So if I had I could only pass 1, but because I didn't I have to pass 2. Alternative could be pass java8 first, then java 11, but it would be the same. To become certified and get eCertificate you have to pass both of them.  This guide covers more than you need to pass exam, because I've added more info evan after I've passed the exam. But this can be even better, cause with this you will understand java deeper.
According to [exam prep guide](https://enthuware.com/resources/java-certification-faq/250-new-java-11-certification-exam-1z0-819) - Originally there were 2 exampls for java 11 `OCP Java 11 part 1 (1Z0-815) and OCP Java 11 part 2 (1Z0-816)`, but from October 2020, it was replaced with single exam [OCP Java 11 (1Z0-819](). But I took exams in late 2019, early 2020, so I have to pass both to earn my badge.

### Java 21
##### Description
OCPJP21 (Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 21 Developer Professional)
If you look into [Java version history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history) you will notice that java 11 was released on September 2018, and java 21 on September 2023, so 5 years has padded and 2 LTS (java 17 and java 21 both LTS versions). So I've decided to review my java knowledge and pass new certification to keep up with java.
